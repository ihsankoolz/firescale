# Decisions log

A running log, newest milestone first. For each milestone: what was built, decisions made on your behalf (with the ADR), known limits, and what needs your decision. Anything you could reasonably disagree with is under "Needs your decision".

## Needs your decision (all milestones, most important first)

1. **Should the result cache be on by default right now?** (M3, ADR 0010) With the one cheap rule that exists today, a warm cached `check` on a 50k-file repo takes about 64 ms and `--no-cache` takes about 32 ms, because proving "nothing changed" means walking the repo. The cache will pay off for content-scanning rules in M5. Options: (a) keep it on, as now; (b) make it opt-in until M5; (c) let each rule declare whether it is worth caching. I kept (a) because PLAN.md's "Done when" describes a cache that is simply on.
2. **Removing the napi binding outright.** (M2, ADR 0008 §3) Nothing calls from Node into Rust any more. If you want the TypeScript SDK to reuse the Rust walker or hasher in-process, a thin binding would have to come back.
3. **"No Node process" under an npm install.** (M2, ADR 0008 §6) The usual npm layout puts a small Node launcher in front of the binary. The design adds an optional hard-link step that removes it where install scripts are allowed. Decide whether that is acceptable when M6 (npm packaging) is built.
4. **Custom rule packs are listed by path only.** (M2, ADR 0008 §5) Loading a pack by npm package name is not supported.
5. **Custom TypeScript rules are never cached.** (M3, ADR 0010) They run on every `check`. Caching them needs a way to hash their source.
6. **`.envrc` is not flagged** by `core/no-committed-env`; `.ENV`-style names are. (M1/M2, ADR 0007 point 10)
7. **TypeScript is pinned to 6.0.3**, not 7, until `typescript-eslint` supports 7. (M0, ADR 0002)

## M3 — Engine: walk, hash, cache

**Built**

- A parallel, gitignore-aware file walker, glob matching for rule inputs, and BLAKE3 content hashing, in `crates/core`.
- A rule-result cache in `.firescale/cache/`. `fscale check --no-cache` bypasses it. `FSCALE_LOG=cache` shows hits and misses.
- Built-in rules that miss the cache run in parallel.
- `bench/generate-fixture.mjs` and `bench/check-bench.mjs`, plus a CI job that runs the 50k-file benchmark on Linux, macOS and Windows.
- The four loose ends from M2: an airtight "no Node process" test (a stand-in `node` binary records whether it was started), tests for the automatic lookup of the Node host, the `core/no-committed-env` SKILL.md now covers case variants (its `explain` snapshot was updated on purpose), and per-OS benchmark numbers from CI.
- PLAN.md reordered: npm packaging is now M6.

**Decisions made for you**

- Walker, globs and hashing use the `ignore`, `globset` and `blake3` crates (ADR 0010).
- The cache key includes whether git tracks each input file, not only file contents, because the one existing rule depends on the git index (ADR 0010).
- "Rule version" in the key is the firescale version, since built-in rules ship inside the binary (ADR 0010).
- firescale writes `.firescale/.gitignore` so the cache is never committed (ADR 0010).
- Custom TypeScript rules are not cached and run one at a time through the single Node host (ADR 0010).
- A new test-only crate, `crates/testkit`, holds the stand-in `node` binary. It is not shipped.
- The help text gained a `--no-cache` line, which changed the help snapshot on purpose.

**Known limits**

- The cache costs a repo walk on every run (see decision 1).
- A rule that reads a file outside its declared `inputs` would be served stale results. Nothing checks this automatically.
- If an input file changes while a check is running, the result can be stored under the key of the old content. The next run recomputes the key and misses, so the stale entry is not served unless the file is changed back.
- The "no Node process" test puts a stand-in `node` first on `PATH`. It would not notice Node started by an absolute path.
- The benchmark CI job records numbers but has no time budget, so a slowdown does not fail it.
- Benchmarks on macOS and Windows come from shared CI runners, so they vary from run to run.
- The host lookup next to the binary searches five parent folders, so in an unusual layout it could find a `firescale` package from a different checkout.

## M2 — Rust front door

**Built:** `fscale` as a native Rust binary with `check`, `explain` and `--version`; JSON config in Rust; `core/no-committed-env` in Rust; the Node bridge for `.ts` config and custom rules; startup benchmarks.

**Decisions made for you:** napi binding removed; TypeScript CLI and TypeScript rule pack removed; custom packs listed by path; `--rules <id>` runs an off rule as report-only with a note on stderr; `serde_json` keeps key order (ADR 0008). CI runs Node 22 and 24 with actions pinned to commit SHAs (ADR 0009).

**Known limits:** nothing is installable from npm yet; the bridge runs a custom rule's `check` but not its `fix`; usage error wording differs from the old CLI.

## M1 — Rule SDK and the first rule

**Built:** the TypeScript rule SDK, config loader, `check`, `explain`, `core/no-committed-env`, the JSON schema for `check --json`.

**Decisions made for you:** config format and strict validation (ADR 0005); fixture repos built at test time (ADR 0006); the rule API (ADR 0007).

## M0 — Skeleton

**Built:** pnpm and Cargo workspaces, CI on three OSes, lint and test tooling.

**Decisions made for you:** toolchain versions (ADR 0002); planning files renamed to `SPEC.md` and `PLAN.md` (ADR 0004).

## Publishing to npm

Not possible yet: packaging is M6 and has not been built. The exact publish steps will be written here when it is.
